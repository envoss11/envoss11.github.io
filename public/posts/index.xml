      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a senior data scientist who&amp;rsquo;s spent most of his career in the insurance/financial services industry. I&amp;rsquo;m aware that &amp;lsquo;data scientist&amp;rsquo; is no longer a particularly useful descriptor, so to elaborate:

The phenomenon observed here shouldn’t be particularly shocking — it’s exactly what we should expect in light of something called Berkson’s Paradox.
This paradox, much like its more famous cousin named after Edward Simpson, isn’t really a paradox at all, but it does lead to some counterintuitive observations. In this example, we appear to see a negative correlation between product quality and sales team quality.</description>
