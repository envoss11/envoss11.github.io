      <description>This post was prompted by this tweet (admittedly already rather old by the time of this posting):
The phenomenon observed here shouldn’t be particularly shocking — it’s exactly what we should expect in light of something called Berkson’s Paradox.
This paradox, much like its more famous cousin named after Edward Simpson, isn’t really a paradox at all, but it does lead to some counterintuitive observations. In this example, we appear to see a negative correlation between product quality and sales team quality.</description>
