[{"content":" This post was prompted by this tweet (admittedly already rather old by the time of this posting):\nThe phenomenon observed here shouldn’t be particularly shocking — it’s exactly what we should expect in light of something called Berkson’s Paradox.\nThis paradox, much like its more famous cousin named after Edward Simpson, isn’t really a paradox at all, but it does lead to some counterintuitive observations. In this example, we appear to see a negative correlation between product quality and sales team quality. You can probably come up with some examples of this on your own — it’s not a particularly novel observation that in the enterprise software world, overpriced and obsolete solutions keep chugging along in the marketplace long past their expiration date simply on the strength of their sales relationships and brand.\nThe ‘paradox’ could be considered a case of sampling bias. In this case, there are two ways of looking at this negative correlation:\nIf a product is low-quality yet continues to persist in the market, it must have an exceptional sales team keeping it afloat.\nIf a product has poor marketing yet continues to persist in the market, it must be of exceptional quality in order to sell.\nIn either case, the bias is introduced by the fact that we’re only looking at products which are successful in the sense that they continue to be developed and sold and the companies producing them haven’t gone out of business.\nIn the following plot (adapted with modifications from an example in Richard McElreath’s Statistical Rethinking, 2nd Ed.), we generate uncorrelated product quality and sales team variables. Look what happens if we highlight just the ‘top performing’ data points (as determined by the sum of product quality and sales team performance):\nSure enough, we can see how the jumble of uncorrelated data points starts to look negatively correlated when you focus your attention on just the top-right quadrant of products. Despite the two variables being completely unrelated, we observe a strong relationship — the best performing sales organizations never have a top-tier product, and the best products always have mediocre sales teams. Paradoxical indeed!\nIf we look at this as implicitly conditioning on the success of the product, we might frame the same problem in terms of a collider bias — a phenomenon in which two variables (product quality and sales team quality) both directly influence the third variable (product success rate) on which we are conditioning, creating the appearance of association between the first two variables:\nI’m still very early in my own causal inference learning journey, but once you start looking out for these concepts in the real world you’ll notice them everywhere — and how easy they are to miss if you haven’t been trained to spot them.\n","permalink":"https://envoss11.github.io/posts/2023-04-26-berkson-s-paradox/","summary":"This post was prompted by this tweet (admittedly already rather old by the time of this posting):\nThe phenomenon observed here shouldn’t be particularly shocking — it’s exactly what we should expect in light of something called Berkson’s Paradox.\nThis paradox, much like its more famous cousin named after Edward Simpson, isn’t really a paradox at all, but it does lead to some counterintuitive observations.

Very rudimentary, but it represents one of my earliest attempts at a \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; predictive modeling problem, and in any case I need some filler content to start populating this site.\nUsing publicly available data from crowd-sourced lending platform Lending Club, I set out to create a classifier which would help solve a marketing problem which (I imagine) a company like this would encounter. I realized that one of the most popular loan types Lending Club provided, debt conslidation, was rather different than the rest from a marketing perspective. An advertisement for a debt consolidation product would likely relate to the stress caused by having too many sources of debt, and then offer to help them simplify that situation. This is the exact opposite of the message one would want to send to persuade a customer to take on a new loan for something like a car or home improvements.\nI chose to focus my analysis on predicting whether a client would be more likely interested in debt consolidation products or other, more conventional loans. The final deliverable for this project was a Shiny app in which a marketing employee could input information about a prospective customer, and receive a response telling them which marketing materials to send them - the standard materials, or something focused on debt consolidation products. I tried out a variety of different models, including a classification tree and bagging and boosting method, finally settling on a model trained with xgboost which maximized the accuracy of my model.\nThe model did not produce mind-blowing results, but it is a clear improvement over just guessing which category a customer might fall into. Playing around with the Shiny app yields mostly sensible results - for example, under the default parameters with a customer having 20 credit lines and 50% credit utilization, the model suggests debt consolidation. Change that number of credit lines to 5 and credit utilization rate to 20%, and the model no longer suggests debt consolidation marketing.\n","permalink":"https://envoss11.github.io/posts/lending_club/","summary":"Shiny app\nGitHub repo\nR Markdown report with code/visualizations\nThis is an old project from school.
