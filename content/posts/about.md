I'm a senior data scientist who's spent most of his career in the insurance/financial services industry. I'm aware that 'data scientist' is no longer a particularly useful descriptor, so to elaborate:

* My main focus these days is cobbling together systems based around generative AI, which falls under the umbrella of data science more for historical reasons than .

* Prior to that, I actually made occasional use of my statistics degree by doing more 'traditional' predictive and inferential modeling (GLMs, tree-based methods, yada yada).

* Prior to *that*, I mostly worked in the time-honored analytics tradition of making pretty dashboards that nobody actually used but allowed leaders to talk about being data-driven.

In addition to providing some basic information about me, this site will showcase a few old side projects (and perhaps some new ones if time permits, which it so rarely does).

If I ever work up the courage to publish my non-professional ramblings somewhere, I'll probably do so [here](https://substack.com/@ericvoss).
