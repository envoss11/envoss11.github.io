I'm a senior data scientist who's spent most of his career in the insurance/financial services industry. I'm aware that 'data scientist' is a nebulous term, so to elaborate:

* My main focus these days is cobbling together systems based around generative AI tools. One could argue that this type of work should fall under the umbrella of software engineering rather than data science (and one would probably be correct).

* Prior to that, I actually made occasional use of my statistics degree by doing more 'traditional' predictive and inferential modeling (GLMs, tree-based methods, yada yada).

* Prior to *that*, I mostly worked in the time-honored analytics tradition of making pretty dashboards which nobody actually used but which allowed leaders to talk about being data-driven.

In addition to providing some basic information about me, this site will showcase a few old side projects (and perhaps some new ones if time permits, which it so rarely does).

My intent is to post other miscellaneous ramblings [here](https://adullroar.substack.com), but I can provide no guarantee of following through on that.
