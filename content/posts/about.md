I'm a Minnesota-based data scientist who leads a small analytics team in the life inusurance industry. I'm focused on supporting underwriting processes through analysis, automation, and AI/ML solutions, with a current focus on building AI-based systems in AWS. I have around 9 years of experience in business intelligence and data science roles across the banking and insurance industries.
