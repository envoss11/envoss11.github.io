I'm a senior data scientist who's spent most of his career in the insurance/financial services industry. I'm aware that 'data scientist' is no longer a particularly useful descriptor, so to elaborate:

* My main focus these days is building systems based around generative AI, which as far as I can tell has less to do with traditional data science and is more akin to imagining what kind of processes you could design with an army of extremely diligent interns who never need to eat, sleep, or take a break but may at any point become detached from reality.

* Prior to that, I actually made occasional use of my statistics degree by doing more 'traditional' predictive and inferential modeling (GLMs, tree-based methods, yada yada).

* Prior to *that*, I mostly worked in the time-honored analytics tradition of making pretty dashboards that nobody actually used but allowed leaders to talk about being 'data-driven'.

This site will function both as a convenient location to showcase a few old side projects and as a sort of public journal where I can jot down my thoughts so that I have some kind of permanent record of my screaming into the void.
